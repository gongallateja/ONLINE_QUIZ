Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure JDK 11 or later is installed.
SQLite: SQLite database should be set up.
JavaFX: Required for the user interface (if applicable).

Setup SQLite Database

Create the SQLite database file and tables. Use the following SQL schema to set up your database:
-- Create users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Create quizzes table
CREATE TABLE quizzes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Create questions table
CREATE TABLE questions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    quiz_id INTEGER,
    question_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    option1 TEXT NOT NULL,
    option2 TEXT NOT NULL,
    option3 TEXT NOT NULL,
    option4 TEXT NOT NULL,
    correct_option INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (quiz_id) REFERENCES quizzes(id)
);

-- Create quiz_results table
CREATE TABLE quiz_results (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER,
    quiz_id INTEGER,
    score INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (quiz_id) REFERENCES quizzes(id)
);


Configure the Application
Ensure the applicationâ€™s database connection settings are correctly configured to match your SQLite database.
